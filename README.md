🧐 Why It Matters?

On-time delivery is critical in logistics and e-commerce. Predicting shipment delays helps companies improve customer satisfaction and reduce operational costs by enabling proactive actions.



📊 Data Overview

The dataset contains approximately 11,000 records.  
Data source: [Kaggle - Customer Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics)



🧠 Model Used

We used a Logistic Regression model — effective for binary classification tasks due to its simplicity and interpretability.



📈 Accuracy and Evaluation

Model performance metrics:  
• Accuracy: 63%  
• Precision: 71%  
• Recall: 67%  
• F1 Score: 69%

This initial model provides a solid baseline for predicting shipment delays.  
With further data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning, the performance can be significantly improved.



🛠️ Technologies Used  
• Python  
• Pandas  
• NumPy  
• Scikit-learn  
• Matplotlib  
• Seaborn



📊 Visualizations

We used various charts (bar, box, histogram, pie) to explore delivery patterns, customer ratings, discounts, and product importance.



▶️ How to Run

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle  
2. Place the downloaded CSV file in the same folder as the notebook  
3. Open the notebook file: OnTime_Delivery.ipynb  
4. Run all cells to execute the full process — from data loading to model evaluation
