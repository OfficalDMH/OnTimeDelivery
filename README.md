🧐 Why It Matters?

On-time delivery is critical in logistics and e-commerce. Predicting shipment delays helps companies improve customer satisfaction and reduce operational costs by enabling proactive actions.

⸻

📊 Data Overview

The dataset contains approximately 11,000 records.  
Data source: Kaggle — Delivery Time Prediction Dataset

⸻

🧠 Model Used

We used a Logistic Regression model — effective for binary classification tasks due to its simplicity and interpretability.

⸻

📈 Accuracy and Evaluation

Model performance metrics:  
• Accuracy: 63%  
• Precision: 71%  
• Recall: 67%  
• F1 Score: 69%

This initial model provides a solid baseline for predicting shipment delays.  
With further data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning, the performance can be significantly improved.

⸻

🛠️ Technologies Used  
• Python  
• Pandas  
• NumPy  
• Scikit-learn  
• Matplotlib  
• Seaborn

⸻

📊 Visualizations

We used various charts (bar, box, histogram, pie) to explore delivery patterns, customer ratings, discounts, and product importance.
